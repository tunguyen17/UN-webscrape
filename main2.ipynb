This is an establishment purposely to create more educational opportunities /buildings for farming communities or villages who have limited access to better education to make up the education chances in the rural areas.  This foundation is therefore going to give the less privilege children and youth in the Community the opportunity to have access to quality education. || Implementation methodologies : The projects work plan is laid out and the establishment will depend on the finances. Researchers in the project will directly interact with the villagers and local officials, and will conduct surveys and in-depth interviews to garner education histories in the Takpo, and Gyiili and according to gathered data they will set accurate strategies and work in effective educational development in these areas and surroundings.James will build the project in phases depending on the regularity of the funds inflow from the sources of funding. It is expected and estimated that the schools will take 6 months to be completed.

      "Description/achievement of initiative : The Toilet Board Coalition is a business led coalition that shares a joint-vision and is committed to providing the necessary leadership, mentorship and investment needed to accelerate the pace of change to achieve universal access to aspirational toilet experiences. We work at the systems level to co-create the necessary ecosystem to support sanitation businesses to scale. And, we work directly with promising businesses in emerging and frontier markets that have the potential to deliver sustainable and resilient sanitation at scale. || Implementation methodologies : The Toilet Board Coalition (TBC) was created by leading businesses, Unilever, Kimberly-Clark, Firmenich and Lixil to bring a business view, approach and new solutions to the global sanitation crisis and aims to bring speed and scale to promising business models that will help us to achieve universal access to sanitation before 2030. Our goal is to catalyse a robust business sector delivering sanitation to low-income markets, profitably and at scale, changing lives.In January 2016 we have launched a corporate accelerator program to facilitate private sector engagement and mentorship to sanitation businesses and entrepreneurs serving low-income markets. The Toilet Accelerator works with promising sanitation business models that have the potential to overcome current barriers to access, use and adherence at scale. More than toilets alone, we are supporting commercially viable businesses at every point in the sanitation value chain.We focus on commercial viability, de-risking and scale. We take a human centred design approach: test all ideas; don't be afraid to fail; build on learnings to get to a viable solution. We insist on commercial rigour, leveraging deep understanding of consumer insights, social &amp; environmental issues, and commercial investment analysis.At the TBC we also work at the systems level to co-create the necessary ecosystem to support sanitation businesses to scale  this is where our Feasibility Cohort Program comes in. In 2016 we are focusing on new and exciting themes for the sector as part of 3 'Feasibility cohorts' to explore how the TBC might support and grow businesses in the sanitation value chain where we see profound potential for transformative growth. || Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer  : The Toilet Board Coalition works with sanitation businesses in three ways: accelerating; Identifying promising sanitation business models with prospect for scale  and matching expert mentors from across the TBC membership to address critical business issues to ensure access to capital and partnerships for scale, co-innovating new solutions where critical components of the system do not exist, i.e. leveraging the innovation &amp; R&amp;D; departments of our sophisticated TBC member companies to solve business and technology issues, and bundling; identifying opportunities to bundle sanitation to other solutions also targeting the same users, i.e. affordable housing, water, energy, and mobile for development.Our calendar year culminates in the Toilet Businesses &amp; Innovators Summit, the first sanitation forum focused on the Business of Sanitation for all. A platform in which to curate, strengthen and grow the global pipeline of inclusive sanitation businesses, the Summit takes what we do in our Accelerator Cohort to a greater level - affording an opportunity for the business ecosystem of sanitation to come together, learn and collaborate. The place to be to see the the latest and greatest innovations in toilets and sanitation systems for the poor; business models that are working around the world; to connect solutions and to meet corporate investors with an interest in taking sanitation to scale through the market. || Coordination mechanisms/governance structure : The TBC has registered as a Swiss Non-Profit Association on 3 December 2015.The Toilet Board Coalition consists of: Directors: as legal representatives of the association internally and externally Steering Committee (SC): core decision-making and governance, functioning as a board of directors that set the strategy of the work program of the Secretariat and governs its operations (TBC Accelerator), decision-making power on the selection of initiatives that the TBC Accelerator works with to de-risk for scalability and investment, potential investors in the initiatives post-Accelerator The Partnership Council (PC): expert advisory group, contribute to the building of the pipeline of initiatives with recommendations and screening Secretariat: management, research, communications, advocacy and administrativefunctions, execute the strategy and work program of the TBC as agreed by the SC, run the TBC Accelerator by facilitating the engagement of the Coalition &amp; partners, identify and manage the pipeline of global sanitation businesses, engage with the global sanitation community and key stakeholdersWe have created a platform for global business leaders to join the global sanitation community in a public-private partnership with the aim to accelerate the delivery of universal access to sanitation. We are catalysing a robust business sector to help to deliver sanitation profitably with speed, at scale, and accessible to all. We are investing in business and technical capacity building for promising business models along the complete sanitation value chain, in emerging and frontier markets - providing access to capital, and hands on corporate mentorship. We are bringing global marketing power to raise awareness of the crisis and to present business solutions that meet the needs of people today and satisfy our aspirations  ",

This will increase the incomes of the poorest families and improve the nutritional conditions of boys, girls and mothers. The government has committed to scale-up the initiative. || Implementation methodologies : The SDG Fund is supporting 4 municipalities to provide integrated approaches to food security. It has been targeting children aged  between 2 and  5, by increasing livelihood opportunities of fruit producers. These pilot programmes are expected to be included into national policies and to be scaled up.

      "Description/achievement of initiative : The project aim is to harness the Food, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Land-use and Energy (FABLE) nexus through upscaling Waste-to-Wealth Enterprises (WWE).  conceptually, scalable bio-waste recycling operations generate bio-energy (biogas and briquettes), organic fertilizers and biocides to help in; a) substituting firewood/charcoal with bio-energy; b) promoting organic farming; c) improving municipal sanitation; d) reducing youths unemployment. This iinnovative pathway, based on entrepreneurship and inter-sector linkages goes beyond technology, equipment and physical infrastructure. It incorporates non-tech initiatives that include psycho-social, cultural; economic and policy dimensions for sustainable development. WWE projects piloted so far make economic sense even in absence of social-benefit accounting. || Implementation methodologies : Developing and demonstrating technical &amp; business models of waste-wealth-enterprises (WWE) include;  : a.\tTechnical processes: Supported by Uganda National Biogas Association (UNBA), a community-based biogas unit has been set-up at Ndejje trading centre to demonstrate biogas productions. With support from UNREEEA and GIZ, a one-stop canter for demonstrating all forms of renewable energy (including solar, wind energy, biomass and biogas is being planned at the main campus of Ndejje University in Luweero District.  : b.\tEntrepreneurial processes; this dimension focuses on the business aspects of producing bioenergy at affordable costs and technical requirements. The processes rotate around; feasibility/cost-benefit analyses; returns on investment/pay-back analyses; branding, marketing and distribution networks; analysis of competitiveness of briquettes and biogas relative to traditional energy (firewood, charcoal, electricity) : i. The proof-of-concept briquettes production project at St Kizito High School; a complete chain of briquettes production and consumption has been piloted successfully at the school; with the following components; i) waste collection bins used to collect and sort waste at source ii) a carboniser that transforms bio-waste into carbon; iii) a unit that crushes carbon into biochar; iv) an extruder that produces briquettes; v) a solar drier that removes moisture from the briquettes; vi) packaging unit; vii) facilities for storage and transportation of briquettes; viii) a commercial scale oven that uses briquettes to bake; ix) a kitchen representing use of briquettes for household cooking; x) school kitchen representing institutional cooking; stoves that use briquettes for institutional cooking; xi) Smart agricultural units that use biochar (and ash from stoves) as fertilisers and biocides. Students and neighbouring communities are practically taken through the stages. The project reveals that; i) an educational institution can depend on briquettes for cooking (without firewood being used); ii) cooking for 1100 students consumes 7000 Kg of briquettes in 100 days; iii) by producing 7000 kg of briquettes, the average net income generated is $ 1000.  With capital investment of $ 12,250, operational costs of $1000 and payback period on investment at 14.7 months.  : ii. Integration of waste recycling with Smart Agriculture.  The organic waste that do not make good briquettes is converted into biochar and applied into organic farming. NDU also demonstrates designs for making biocides and disinfectants from bio-waste. An irrigation system powered by solar energy has been developed. Space is optimally utilized in growing high value vegetables. Ornamental gardening is also demonstrated to represent aspects of municipal beautification and greening. || Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer || Coordination mechanisms/governance structure || Partner(s) : Kampala Capital City Authority : Uganda National Council of Science and Technology  : National water and Sewerage Corporation  : Ministries of a) Energy and Mineral Development : Water and Environment  : Uganda National Biogas Association  : Biomass Energy Efficient Technologies Association : Uganda National Renewable Energy Alliance\n",

      "Description/achievement of initiative : In 2011 the Pacific Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and Climate Change 'communities' and regional intergovernmental mechanisms agreed to combine their efforts to develop an integrated Pacific regional strategy for Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change by 2015 to succeed the Pacific Disaster Risk Reduction and Disaster Management Framework for Action 2005  2015 and the Pacific Islands Framework for Action on Climate Change 2006  2015. SPREP, SPC and UNISDR held for the first time 2013 Joint Meeting of the Pacific Platform for Disaster Risk Management &amp; Pacific Climate Change Roundtable which was followed by the process to develop the abovementioned strategy.The agreement and initiative taken to develop an integrated regional strategy for DRM and Climate Change makes the Pacific the first region in the world to take constructive steps towards combining regional, national and sub national efforts to reduce the risks to sustainable national development posed by disasters and climate change.  The process by which the Strategy is being developed is currently referred to as the Roadmap whilst the Strategy itself is currently being referred to as the Strategy for Climate and Disaster Resilient Development (SRDP).The 'Roadmap' has three major anticipated outputs, as follows: 1. Strategy for Climate and Disaster Resilient Development in the Pacific (SRDP), (to be effective from 2016) 2. Pacific Regional Synthesis Report 2015: Report on the implementation progress of thePacific Disaster Risk Reduction and Disaster Management Framework for Action 2005  2015 &amp;  Pacific Islands Framework for Action on Climate Change 2006  2015 3.

      "Plastic was first introduced in the 1950s and is a common word which refers to manmade chemical compounds such as polystyrene which is used to produce the carry out foam containers and polypropylene used for bottles caps. There are numerous types of plastic used in the world today and found to be a common marine debris around the Pacific (NOAA, 2011). Such that, a growing concern of marine pollution is the increase of disposable plastic items in our oceans. The nation of Fiji depends on the oceans and its resources for food, livelihood and cultural traditions and this will be affected by the rise in disposable plastic items in our Oceans.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to an article from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,2011), states that plastics will degraded into smaller fragments of plastic debris known as microplastics. These microplastics have been observed by scientist as the accumulation of the improper disposal of plastic in the ocean for at least over the last four decades (Andrady, 2011). Microplastics or plastic being improperly disposed into the ocean will affect the marine life. Marine organisms such as fish species and corals may mistake plastic for food causing starvation, also at least 17% of species are affected by entanglement (Gall & Thompson, 2015), which cause suffocation. \n",

      "Description/achievement of initiative : The United Nations Institute of Training and Research (UNITAR) is the UN training arm for social and economic development, environmental services and multilateral diplomacy. UNITAR's mission is to develop capacities to enhance global decision-making and support country level action for shaping a better future. UNITAR and its affiliated global network of International Training Centres for Local Actors (CIFAL) organise around 400 training activities yearly reaching out to some 25,000 beneficiaries.The Global Network of International Training Centres for Local Actors (CIFAL) are hubs for capacity building and knowledge sharing between government authorities, international organisations, the private sector and civil society. || Implementation methodologies : CIFAL Centres provide training services such as: Face to Face Training (short to medium-term trainings, workshops, courses, etc.) E-Learning courses Blended programmesIn designing and delivering its training activities, CIFAL Centres employ a variety of methods, including: Concept learning (presentations by practitioners, lectures, etc.)  Real world exposure (field visits) Experience sharing (discussion groups, expert panels, etc.)For its local development work, CIFALs use the knowledge management methodology called CityShare. This methodology consists of various processes of self-assessment, distillation and transmission of experiences and good practices in order to improve the performance of an organization. They also include several tools that provide a common language for the evaluation, exchange and adaptation of the experiences shared by participating cities, as well as a roadmap for action and progress.  The process aims at optimizing peer learning between local government officials and key stakeholders. Participants share knowledge, experiences, good practice and lessons learned, in order to build a strategic action plan integrating international conventions into local development programmes. || Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer  : UNITAR seeks to continue delivering local development training via the CIFAL Network through a balanced geographical distribution. New CIFALs are being opened to respond to current demand from sub-regions such as the Arab world, the majority of Central American countries, Central Asian countries, and parts of Africa. UNITAR' partners with leading local institution with proven expertise and value added to three thematic areas guiding UNITAR's local development training:Post-2015 Development Agenda and the SDGsUrban Governance and PlanningEconomic DevelopmentSocial InclusionEnvironmental Sustainability || Coordination mechanisms/governance structure : UNITAR's affiliated global network of International Training Centres for Local Actors (CIFAL) is comprised of 14 training centres located in North, Central and South America, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. Each CIFAL Centre is a regional hub for capacity development bringing together public sector, private sector and civil society. CIFALs assist local actors in achieving sustainable development in the context of increasing responsibilities at local level. UNITAR oversees, supports and coordinates the actions of the CIFAL Centres worldwide in accordance with the UNITAR Statute and policies and its Strategic Framework. The first CIFAL Centre was created in 2003. Since then the CIFAL network has grown to 14 centres (as of January 2015) and has been successful in creating learning environments for knowledge transfer while hosting a large number of workshops for thousands of beneficiaries globally. In 2014, CIFAL Centres delivered 66 training programmes reaching out to more than 8,000 participants from local and national governments, civil society, and private sector institutions. UNITAR works hand in hand with local partners from different sectors with the objective of assisting local actors in achieving sustainable development in the context of increasing responsibilities at local level. CIFAL Centres represent a model for collaboration between the United Nations and local authorities to meet a crucial need to reinforce capacities and exchange good practices among local authorities, the private sector, civil society, and key national change agents || Partner(s) : United Nations Institute of Training and Research (UNITAR), Federation of Industries of the State of Parana (Brazil), Airport Group of the South of Mexico (ASUR), International Peace Foundation (ROK), Kuala Lumpur City Hall Training Institute (Malaysia), Regional Cooperation Office for City Informatization (China), Moray Council (Scotland), Municipality of Plock (Poland), City of Antwerp (Belgium), Municipality of Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), E-thekwini Municipality (South Africa), Decentralized Government of the Province of Pichincha (Ecuador), Ministry of Interior and Local Authorities (Algeria), Vice presidency of the Republic of El Salvador, Kennesaw State University (USA).\n",

      "Description/achievement of initiative : Nigeria's inability to achieve the millennium development goals (MDGs) is a political as well as a civilian issue. Nigerians need to be aware of who their leaders are in order to keep them accountable, lobby them, and go out and vote. It is imperative that people voices are heard so they can take a proactive stance on pertinent issues and develop a culture of volunteerism. Information to community members on government policy and their inclusion in development planning especially at the local level are all crucial steps towards rural developments. Poor capacity of community members to engage relevant government stakeholders on responsiveness, accountability and transparency is another major factor hampering development at the grassroots. Creating awareness on the sustainable development goals (SDGs) among community members and concerned government stakeholders will improve and sustain interactions between government and the people, thereby setting a platform towards achieving the SDGs by 2030 through increased demand for improved services delivery. || Implementation methodologies : Awareness creation forms part of a change-oriented communication in which all the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and targets will be communicated to other civil society organizations (CSOs), traditional rulers, and marginalized community groups in response to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In response this multi-stakeholders will become stimulated to contribute their own ideas and energies, thus contributing to live debates on sustainable issues. To achieve this, there will be community mobilizations, CSOs/ government interactive sessions on the SGDs and their targets, media platforms on print/electronic media, capacity building for community stakeholders and government MDAs, publications, banners, flyers, t-shirts, brochures, and the creation of social network platforms, and promotional materials (manuals) with graphic work for the semi-literate and illiterate community members. || Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer  : Transfer of experts and equipment for appropriate learning through capacity building of different stakeholders such as governments, communities, private sector entities, and utilize, according to local conditions. The effectiveness of the technology transfer will be based on capacity building and enabling environments to enable target stakeholders understanding. Most community leaders are semi-illiterate, while some government officials lack required capacity to effectively plan and implement sustainable development projects. New technology transfer with required capacity would also be adopted to effectively create needed awareness in the minds of all identified stakeholders in response to 2030 sustainable development agenda. || Coordination mechanisms/governance structure : There will be a Project Steering Committee (PCS), which will be the highest project decision making organ, but Vanguard for Change-Nigeria will coordinate all awareness creation activities with other identified partners and stakeholders and submit report to relevant institution. Implementation of  activities will be quarterly to be preceded by a review meeting of partners to identified challenges and ways forward. There will be capacity building for community stakeholders and media platforms for wider public sensitization || Partner(s) : Vanguard for Change-Nigeria, Society for the Renaissance of African Art and Culture (SOTARAC), Life Gate Initiative, local government officials, elected local, state and federal legislators, traditional rulers, members of town unions, community based organizations, and the media\n",

      "Description/achievement of initiative : Mato Grosso maintains the highest Amazon deforestation rates. In the attempt to scale up local successful projects and launch sustainable development model for Mato Grosso State, regional Civil Society Organizations and municipalities have teamed up to build the Sustainable Municipalities Program (PMS).  Launched in 2014, the PMS aims to reduce Amazon deforestation, end poverty and food insecurity by means of three goals: (1) strengthening of municipal environmental management; (2) environmental and land tenure regularization; (3) promotion of sustainable production chains with focus on family agriculture. || Implementation methodologies : The PMS governance bases follow the principle of connecting local (bottom-up) and state government (top-down) decisions regarding environmental and agricultural agendas as well as increase  participation of CSOs in these decisions. The PMS' high-level decision arena receives inputs from local government through target plans. These target plans are discussed at the bottom, with local governments together with their local environmental councils (attended by the local civil society). The target plan discussions are guided by the priority agendas described in each of PMS axis. || Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer || Coordination mechanisms/governance structure : The PMS governance model is composed by a Management Commitee (MC), a Executive Commitee (EC), and five Work Groups (WG - land tenure, financial resource, productive sustainable chain, target plan, training and learning). All those PMS governance components have representatives from civil society organizations, private sector and state government. The MC is the PMS high level decision body. It meets four times a year  and aims to discuss structural problems faced by PMS. The WGs are not permanent bodies, but they change accordingly to PMS needs and they gather to discuss specific issues or to respond to specific needs. The only two WG which have remained over the years are the WG for financial resource and the  WG for training and learning with have constantly had activities regarding PMS structural concerns.The Mato Grosso municipalities are a diffuse component of PMS' governance arrangement. In order to be part of PMS actions, each municipality has to commit itself to a target plan. The target plan is a sort-long term plan to be designed by the municipality government according to the PMS three axis. In this plan, each municipality describes  its needs for  each goal, identifies the financial resources needed as well as the timeframe in which to achieve the goal. The local government commits itself to hold these goals together  with the PMS support. || Partner(s) : Mato Grosso State, Instituto Centro de Vida, Instituto Socioambiental, Instituto Brasileiro de Administração Municipal (IBAM), The Nature Conservancy, Associação Mato-grossense dos Municípios (AMM), Instituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da Amazônia (IPAM), SEBRAE, Fundo Vale, Avina, Instituto Ação Verde, Earth Innovation Institute, Agroicone, Sistema OCB/MT, Climate and Land Use Alliance, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Skoll Foundation\n",

      "The State of California has taken an ecosystem-based approach to ensuring sustainable marine ecosystems through the creation of a network of marine protected areas and development of fishery management plans for commercial and recreational fisheries.  Fishery management plans include information necessary to make informed decisions on sustaining marine resources while allowing harvest opportunities, including a description of the fishery, fishery science, conservation measures, habitat requirements, bycatch and discards, status of overfishing/rebuilding, and management options.\n",
      "\n",
      "California has fishery management plans for nearshore fisheries, market squid, and white seabass.  The State also recently finalized a management plan for the California spiny lobster fishery, which includes a harvest control rule that incorporates the contributions of marine protected areas to spawning output of the lobster population, linking fisheries management measures with expected marine protected area performance.  California commits to finalizing fishery management plans for the abalone and herring fisheries by 2018 and releasing a case study on the integration of the States marine protected areas and fisheries management measures by 2018.\n",

      "Additionally, California commits to updating its Master Plan for Fisheries - a roadmap for implementing sustainable management of state-managed fisheries and for prioritizing fisheries in the greatest need of management and conservation measures. The updated Master Plan for Fisheries will be informed by information gathering projects that are developing tools and recommendations to improve fisheries management in California. These projects address a wide range of projects including climate change and fisheries, socioeconomics, partnerships, stakeholder engagement, ecosystem considerations and prioritization.  \n",

      "Description/achievement of initiative : Since 2009 PIFON has been working as informal network. It began with assistance from development agencies such as FAO, CTA and IFAD.  However, in early 2013 PIFON became operational as a legal entity in its own right. It is a partnership of the network members. The Vision of PIFON is that: Farmer organisations (FOs) become a major driving force in securing financially worthwhile and sustainable livelihoods for rural households in the Pacific.  Its Mission is to make Pacific FOs more vibrant, viable and sustainable organisations.  The underlying philosophy guiding PIFON's Operations:A regional farmer organisation network is necessary to create linkages between national FOs and to improve the flow of relevant information and resources to facilitate the participation of rural households in income earning agriculture.PIFON Objectives:To establish a sustainable organisation with wide membership across the Pacific Islands. PIFON partners provide one another with key contacts, information and the technical expertise required to achieve overall viability. They provide farmer organisations with key contacts, information and the technical expertise required to enable their members to better participate in commercial agriculture. To provide national FOs with key contacts, information and the technical expertise required to increase the productivity and environmental sustainability of their members farming operations. To raise the profile of FOs in the Pacific and give farmers a voice in regional and international forums â influencing and securing farmer driven donor support.PIFON's strategic plan can be seen here,  http://www.pacificfarmers.com/strategic-plan-2014-2016/ || Implementation methodologies : Training, networking, face-to-face exchange of knowledge and information || Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer  : Partners in the network exchange views and ideas in annual planning exercises and ad hoc according to needs and available resources. || Coordination mechanisms/governance structure : The partnership amongst PIFON members is governed by an elected a Board of Directors.

      "Description/achievement of initiative : With the desire to move forward with a greater degree of commitment, the Universitat de Barcelona has approved a Sustainability Plan with the following strategic objectives: reduce the environmental impact of the organization in all its areas of activity; improve efficiency in energy consumption and natural resources; integrate the values and principles of sustainability in decision making and incorporate good environmental practices at all levels of the institution; encourage and continue carrying out projects in the field of sustainability to help perform an action exemplary both in the UB as other government and private entities. || Implementation methodologies : The UB Sustainability Plan is divided into 10 strategic lines, each with its own specific objectives:- Natural Values- Spatial Planning and Sustainable Construction- Mobility- Environmental Quality- Energy and Natural Resources- Waste- Communication and Awareness- Cooperation and Volunteering- Curricular Greening- Sustainability ResearchThis initiative has a total of 128 actions, for which have been defined responsibles for implementation and monitoring indicators. The technical office reviews the evolution of the actions, coordinates the planification with the Rector's Delegate for Sustainability and produces the annual report. Due to budgetary restrictions, some of the actions are being redefined during the evaluation process, and other are being carried out applying the learning service methodology, in collaboration with specific bachelor's degrees and master's degrees.This has led to a greater boost of the Curricular Greening strategic line, which was stagnant, and has facilitated greater integration of the Sustainability Plan within one of the main activities of the university. || Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer || Coordination mechanisms/governance structure : The Universitat de Barcelona Sustainability Plan, as an institution responsible to provide the public service of higher education through teaching, study and research, also has the responsibility to carry out their work in a sustainable manner, actively participating and promoting social development without contributing to economic and environmental degradation or depletion of natural resources. This vision is specified in article 4.1.e of our Statute, which proclaims and guarantees \"the guidance of teaching and research to the culture of peace, social progress and human development based on human rights and environmental protection and sustainable development\". The UB Statute also envisaged in Article 58.2 the creation of \"a delegate commission that will ensure that the University respects the criteria of sustainability and environmental protection in all its activities. For this purpose, the said Committee shall establish a program of action of the University in the field of ecological and presented to the University Senate an annual report on the implementation of this program\".Following this assignment, the Sustainability Commission (chaired by the Rector's Delegate for Sustainability), designed the Sustainability Plan, and annually approves the Sustainability Plan Report, which is then presented to the Senate of the University.The Office of Health, Safety and Environment provides technical support  in the development and monitoring of the plan, and the various administrative units of the University are involved in carrying out the actions assigned in their area of activity. || Partner(s) : Universitat de Barcelona\n",

      "Description/achievement of initiative : The Partnership implements South/South exchanges and cross-regional learning that strengthen the regional institutional framework supporting climate change planning and finance at the national level within Small Island Developing States (SIDS).Specifically, the Partnership will achieve: \t1.\tShared services and materials: online tools, databases, meta-data, educational material, and publications.2.\tAn inter-regional network of climate modellers to support planning for climate change.3.\tKnowledge sharing on the integration of adaptation and disaster risk reduction, and national planning for climate change.4.\tRegional Implementing Entity (RIE) Accreditation under the Adaptation Fund and support to SIDS in attaining National Implementing Entity (NIE) status.5.\tAn Implementation Plan for the IOC.6.\tJoint approaches to development partners. || Implementation methodologies : While a number of organisations in the region work on climate change concerns from their own perspectives (health, agriculture, etc), CCCCC is the only regional body with climate change as its core concern, and addresses this matter in a multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary way. The Centre's experience in its evolution from a regional adaptation programme to fully-fledged institution, and in particular its work in developing an Implementation Plan (2011-2021) for the Regional Framework for Achieving Development Resilient to Climate Change, is of particular value to the partnership and an aspect it has been keen to share with the IOC. || Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer  : Partners have enacted the spirit of their Memoranda of Understanding through a comprehensive analysis of the three regional organisations to define a practical programme of work. Targeted inter-regional exchanges have taken place, and institutional assessments have created an effective basis for shared services and Centre-to-Centre learning. || Coordination mechanisms/governance structure : Each institution has its strengths and contributions to make in the context of the Partnership:Caribbean Community Climate Change CentreThe Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre coordinates the Caribbean region's response to climate change. Opened in August 2005, the Centre is the key node for information on climate change issues and on the region's response to managing and adapting to climate change in the Caribbean. It is a repository and clearing house for regional climate change information and data, and provides climate change-related policy advice and guidelines to the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) states. || Partner(s) : Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre : Indian Ocean Commission : Secretariat for the Pacific Regional Environment Programme : Commonwealth Secretariat\n",
