Many valued species have been driven to commercial extinction. If human-related impacts are not understood and managed, serious consequences will result for the ecological health of the Earths oceans, coastal communities, global food security, and the many other benefits humans derive from the ocean. Enhanced global research and management partnerships are required across sectors and geopolitical boundaries for successful future ocean management. The Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) is a global research, technology, data management and partnership platform committed to advancing scientific knowledge of the worlds ecologically, culturally, and commercially important aquatic animals to ensure their conservation and sustainable management.\\n\\r\\nOTN is committing to providing the technology, data infrastructure and logistical support to use electronic telemetry to document the movements, survival, intra- and interspecific interactions, and habitat use (including occupancy of marine protected areas) of free-ranging at-risk and valued species of marine life. The work is done in collaboration with a growing number of international collaborators, making the work cost effective and ensuring that local knowledge needs are addressed. OTN will also operate its fleet of autonomous marine vehicles to sample oceanographic conditions in its North Atlantic and North Pacific Ocean areas of operation, contributing the data to researchers working on animal tracking, climate change, weather and storm forecasting, and oceanography. Access to the data and resources of the OTN will be provided free of charge to registered users.'\n",

A total of ten Caribbean countries will be participating in the project.  \\n \\n \\n : Implementation methodologies\\nBesides the lead project implementing and executing agencies, several partners have been identified within an IWEco Project Partnership during the course of project development.  Given the areas of engagement of the various agencies, the project partnership is divided into three main technical groupings based on their contributions to the project; (1) Research, (2) Governance and (3) Public awareness and public education.  Two support partnership groupings around resource mobilization and private sector participation take into account of the contributions and advisory support of financial sector agencies and the private sector.  Community beneficiaries are partners at the local project levels.  The  partners arrangement is presented in graph form.  \\n : Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer \\nThe project has four components; (1) Development and Implementation of Integrated Targeted Innovative, climate-change resilient approaches in sustainable land management (SLM), integrated water resources management (IWRM) and maintenance of ecosystem services; (2) Strengthening of the SLM, IWRM and ecosystems Monitoring, and Indicators framework; (3) Strengthening of the Policy, legislative and institutional reforms and capacity building for SLM, IWRM and ecosystem services management taking into consideration climate change resilience building and (4) Enhancing knowledge exchange, best practices, replication and stakeholder involvement.  The project will be implemented through a network of international, regional and national partners in accordance with their comparative advantage. Component 1 is focusing on technology transfer while Component 3 is dedicated to capacity building and Component 4 is on knowledge management, fostering community of practices, knowledge transfer.\\n : Coordination mechanisms/governance structure\\nThe project will be implemented through a network of international, regional and national partners along thematic lines, in accordance with capacity advantage based on institutional mandates of these partners. While UNEP and UNDP will act as GEF Implementing Agencies, UNEP Car/RCU in partnership with the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) will serve as co-Executing Agencies for day to day project coordination.

      "'Slow Fish was born as a Slow Food awareness-raising campaign around the challenges faced by small-scale fishing communities across the world. Today, in a global context where the industrial food production model is predominant, Slow Fish represents a solid network of fishers, biologists, academics, journalists and many other actors in the seafood production chain who share a common interest in defending and promoting a good, clean and fair food system. All the activities carried out at national level as well as international projects pursue two interdependent goals: to raise awareness among citizens of sustainable consumption patterns and to support the small-scale fishing communities worldwide. The health of the oceans, and of the entire global water system, is inseparable from the health and welfare of those who rely on the seas, rivers and lakes, and who produce respecting the balance of their ecosystems. By promoting such practices, Slow Fish fosters the exchange of knowledge between different communities, with the aim of creating more favorable conditions for their survival and indeed, the preservation of the environment in which they operate. The overall goal of Slow Fish is to increase the economic and social well-being of local communities and their commitment to conservation, and to promote sustainable management of marine and coastal zones through the sustainable use of local food resources as the driving force of local development with a cultural identity.\\r\\nThe Slow Fish network took root in the Mediterranean and has developed over the years by embracing various other areas of the world, including North America, Northern Europe, North Africa and Latin America.\\r\\nIn the near future, the network intends to expand in other strategic areas based on good practices developed and tested in the Caribbean. The aim is to replicate this successful model to expand the network across the world and scale-up results. Thanks to the support of the EU, the experience gained in Mexico and Colombia will be analysed, compared and systematized. The exchange within Slow Fish network and with relevant satkholders will be strongly supported through the organization of international events reaching out to large public, decision-makers and all actors along the food chain.'\n",

To this end, throughout is implementation, the Global Partnership engages in key capacity-building and knowledge transfer activities with partners by: (i) generating data and evidence on progress in meeting commitments for more effective development co-operation through its inclusive monitoring framework; (ii) administering a country-focused approach that helps developing countries make the best use of development co-operation to realise their national development goals; and (iii) leading multi-stakeholder dialogue amongst development stakeholders at local, country, regional and global levels. \\nThe evidence generated from the GPEDC also provides inputs to the review of SDG targets on respecting countries\\x92 policy space and leadership (SDG 17.15); multi-stakeholder partnerships for development (SDG 17.16); and gender equality and women\\x92s empowerment (SDG 5c). Data also informs the Inter-Agency Task Force report for FfD.\\n : Coordination mechanisms/governance structure\\nThe Global Partnership is led by three ministerial co-chairs and governed by a multi-stakeholder Steering Committee. Senior government officials from Bangladesh, Germany and Uganda lead the Global Partnership and advocate for effective development co-operation across the globe.\\nThe Steering Committee is the Global Partnership\\x92s multi-stakeholder governing body. It meets biannually to guide the work of the Global Partnership and ensure that it is carried out transparently, fully consulting each stakeholder group. Members include representatives from recipients and providers of development co-operation, the business sector, parliaments, civil society, multilateral development banks, UNDP/UNDG, OECD/DAC, Arab providers of development co-operation, trade unions, foundations, and sub-national governments. \\nSince 2012, UNDP, together with its partners at OECD, has supported the effective functioning of the Global Partnership as its Joint Support Team. This role is based on UNDP\\x92s track-record in supporting countries in implementing the Paris Declaration, the Accra Agenda for Action, and the Busan Partnership principles as well as strengthening national capacity for development management and co-ordination. \\nSince 2012, UNDP and OECD have supported the effective functioning of the Global Partnership as its Joint Support Team. \\n : Partner(s)\\nThe Busan Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation, giving birth to the Global Partnership, was endorsed  by 161 countries and heads of multilateral and bilateral institutions, and representatives of public, civil society, private, parliamentary, local and regional stakeholders. From 2017-2018, the Global Partnership is led by 3 ministerial-level co-chairs from the Finance Ministry of Bangladesh, Federal Ministry for Economic Co-operation and Development of Germany, and Planning and Economic Development Ministry of Uganda, guided by a 20-member Steering Committee and supported by the OECD and UNDP Joint Support Team.\\nThe Global Partnership also has a network of 29 Global Partnership Initiatives (GPIs), led by 58 organisations. These are voluntary initiatives, also known as the think tanks of the Global Partnership as they work in a range of development fields that directly contribute to implementing the Global Partnership\\x92s internationally-agreed development effectiveness principles.'\n",

      "'The scope of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing problems refers to illegal activities conducted by national or foreign fishing vessels in waters under the jurisdiction of a state, without the permission of that state, in contravention of its laws and regulations; or conducted in violation of national laws or international obligations. Unreported fishing means fishing which has not been reported, or has been misreported, to the national authority, in contravention of national laws and regulations. Unregulated fishing means fishing in areas or for fish stocks for which there are no applicable conservation or management measures and where such fishing activities are conducted in a manner inconsistent with state responsibilities for the conservation of living marine resources under international laws (FAO 2001).\\n\\r\\nIUU fishing has several negative impacts, such as unfair competition, loss of biodiversity, loss of income, even loss of human lives. Moreover, there are social and juridical implications made by such consequences. It is obvious that fish stocks has been depleted and in many areas in the world oceans and seas due to various reasons, namely poaching, smuggling, overfishing and violation of the local, regional and international laws. It is also expected that IUU fishing is getting more and more attention in all fishing regions and sub-regions. FAO and GFCM have made several studies and initiatives for combating IUU fishing in all fishing areas.\\n\\r\\nLower and upper estimates of the current total loss per year due to illegal and unreported fishing worldwide are USD 9 billion and USD 24 billion, respectively, representing between 11  and 26 million tonnes of fish (Agnew et al. 2009).\\n\\r\\nIUU fishing is one of the root causes for the decline of fish stocks in the GFCM Area and IUU fishing remains widespread in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.  INTERPOL has launched a project as a global initiative to detect, suppress and combat fisheries crime which is estimated to cost the global economy up to USD 23 billion each year. Fisheries crime threatens food security and livelihoods, and can destabilize vulnerable coastal ecosystems (www.interpol.int).\\n\\r\\nThe nature and extent of the IUU fishing in the  Black  and Mediterrnaean  Sea is not clearly known at present. It is, however, known that this kind of illegal activities are becoming common practices in recent years and getting serious threat for the fish stocks and fishing communities in the region.\\n\\r\\nAll fisheries associations and cooperatives will be encouraged to take an initiative for mitigation or zero tolerance against IUU fisheries in those basen. Public awareness campaigns against IUU fisheries in the Black  and Mediterranean  Seas with the help of fisheries authorities, with the active participation of fishery cooperatives need to be urgently initiated. Overall an effective program should be developed to halt IUU fishing in the region, which includes also vocational trainings and involves relevant academic institutions and research centers existing at local level.\\n\\r\\nTUDAV works very closely with NGOs, marine research centers, fisheries organizations and governments of the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea. \\r\\nIt uses its own technical and financial resources. It is also fundraising for specific projects to achieve this goal.'\n",

      "'The Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and their Habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia (IOSEA Marine Turtles MOU) was established under the auspices of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (UNEP/CMS). Through its Conservation and Management Plan (CMP) the MOU has put in place a framework through which states of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asian region, as well as other Range States, can work together to conserve and replenish depleted marine turtle populations in the region. \\r\\nMajor threats to marine turtles in the IOSEA region include unsustainable exploitation for consumption and trade of meat and eggs, as well as of shell for ornamental purposes; destruction of nesting beaches and feeding habitats such as mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs; and incidental mortality in fishing operations (Bycatches). Other threats to marine turtles include: climate change, artificial light pollution associated with coastal development, marine pollution (especially plastic), abandoned fishing nets, inappropriate beach management strategies, and natural predation by feral animals. \\r\\nThe CMP which has 6 objectives and 105 specific activities serves as a comprehensive blueprint of what needs to be done to conserve marine turtles of the Indian Ocean. It focuses on reducing threats, conserving critical habitats, exchanging scientific data, increasing public awareness and participation, promoting regional cooperation, and seeking resources for implementation.\\r\\nThe MOU has identified five highest priority issues for IOSEA to address in the immediate future: (1) investigation of illegal direct take of marine turtles; (2) identification of index beaches associated with genetic stocks; (3) capacity-building in support of Signatory State efforts; (4) investigation of indirect take in legal fisheries; and (5) socio-economic considerations of relevance to marine turtle conservation. The IOSEA MOU has adopted resolution to promote the use of Marine Turtle Bycatch Reduction Measures by Signatory States.\\n\\r\\nThe IOSEA Marine Turtle MOU is committed to achieving the objectives in its CMP which will contribute enormously to the implementation of SDG14. Its current projects include the extension of an ongoing Technical Support & Capacity-Building Programme, a review of studies and activities related to the socio-economic implications of marine turtle use and conservation, as well as an investigation on the illegal trade of marine turtles in the IOSEA region.\\r\\nAdditional, the OSEA Marine Turtle MoU, has developed a Network of Sites of Importance to promote the long-term conservation of sites of regional and global importance to marine turtles and their habitats in the region. This network serves as a mechanism for sites to operate more cooperatively and synergistically, both ecologically and administratively, rather than working in isolation with minimal coordination.\\r\\nThe IOSEA Marine Turtle MOU is playing an important role in contributing to the implementation of SDG14 and has developed a well-coordinated network of interested actors, delivering a comprehensive programme of necessary interventions, and providing an inclusive forum for regular review of implementation progress.'\n",

The Government will identify areas where conservation measures should be enhanced, including the estuary of the Amazon River, the Abrolhos reef bank and the VitriaTrindade seamount chain, with due consideration to the economic activities in those regions.\\n\\r\\nMangrove areas on the Amazon estuary from Parnaiba to Oyapock represent approximately 80% of total Brazilian mangrove area. This ecosystem complex includes key biodiversity areas for dozens of Nearctic migratory bird species, 2 manatee species and 78 threatened species of fauna and flora, relevant ecosystem services for fisheries nursing grounds, accumulation of carbon and coastal protection. Considerable knowledge gaps remain, including related to a recently-discovered large reef system facing the Amazon river mouth as well as one of the most important mangrove areas globally. Also covered are the contiguous extensive mud floors in front of the mouth of the Amazon River, known as Lixeira or natural debris area, rich in macroalgae and an important nursery area for many fish species and shrimp. \\n\\r\\nThe Abrolhos Reef Bank is located on Brazils continental shelf and harbours the highest levels of biodiversity in South Atlantic waters and the worlds largest rhodolith bed. It presents a mosaic of different habitats such as mangroves, seagrass meadows, rhodolith beds, submerged and emergent reefs, and a group of small volcanic islands. Abrolhos also has unique biological formations such as the large mushroom-shaped reef formations (chapeires), and unique geological formations such as the buracas (distinctive depressions in the shelf plain). Closer to the coastal area there is a tradition of engaging local and traditional communities and peoples in de facto co-management of protected areas. \\n\\r\\nThe Vitria-Trindade Chain of Seamounts is one of the major green turtle breeding grounds in the Atlantic and contains at least 11 endemic fish species, 02 endemic species of calcareous algae, and likely the worlds sole breeding site for the Trindade petrel. This area includes the largest breeding grounds of humpback whales in the South Atlantic, 04 endemic coral species, 13 endemic marine fish species and important breeding colonies for dozens of seabirds, including 123 threatened species.'\n",

      "\": Description/achievement of initiative\\nIn 2015, world leaders made a commitment to end all forms of violence against children by 2030, as part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This moment presents an historic opportunity to unite the world behind a global, national and local movement to protect the world\\x92s most precious asset \\x96 its children. The Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children and its associated fund were created to help achieve this ambitious undertaking \\x96 in every country, every community and every family.\\n \\n \\n : Implementation methodologies\\nThe Partnership\\x92s three goals will help us accelerate action and implement work at scale, sharing and implementing evidence-based strategies by building political will, working with countries to accelerate action to tackle the violence that children face, and strengthening collaboration between countries.\\nThe Partnership will build and sustain political will to end violence against children, promoting evidence-based strategies that will lead to significant, sustained and measurable reductions in violence. Most governments accept that violence against children is a serious problem, but few countries are yet to commit to action on a scale needed to achieve measurable reductions in violence. The Partnership will advocate for more urgent action to end all forms of violence, catalyze debate at national, regional and global levels, and make the case for increased investment in preventing and addressing violence. \\nThe Partnership will work with partners to accelerate action to tackle the violence that children face, with a focus on \\x91pathfinder countries\\x92 who wish to lead the movement to end violence. Through the SDGs, all countries have made a commitment to ending violence against children. In line with the principle of inclusivity, the Partnership will provide a platform for any country that is prepared to take action to meet this commitment. Our focus will be on legislation, integrated services for preventing and responding to violence, and on access to social services. Children in conflict settings require special attention.\\nThe Partnership will strengthen collaboration among and between countries, and with civil society and other stakeholders, confronting shared threats and developing shared solutions. The universal nature of Agenda 2030 encourages countries to find new ways of co-operating and learning from each other. An important role for the Partnership will be as a platform for transnational action and learning, and a forum for learning and for the dissemination of knowledge.  Under this goal and related objectives, the Partnership will also aim to communicate the issues to a wide range of actors and stakeholders.\\n : Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer \\nThe above goals are supported by four cross-cutting drivers: movement building, finance and resources, data and evidence, and monitoring and evaluation.\\nMovement Building - The Partnership will mobilize a powerful movement behind a common strategy for building and sustaining political will to end violence against children, for accelerating action to end violence at global, regional, national and local levels, and for strengthening collaboration between and among countries, and with civil society, including child led organizations and other stakeholders. Strong communication at all levels will be a critical part of this effort.  \\nFinance and Resources - Prevention of violence is under-funded in most countries, chronically so in many. To date, governments have failed to invest sufficiently in the systems, program and people needed to keep children safe. \\nThe Partnership will make the case to governments, foundations, philanthropists and the private sector that investment in preventing violence against children offers substantial returns, while increasing the impact of expenditure on health, education and other services for children.\\nData and Evidence - The Partnership is based on a commitment to evidence. It will use research and data to build political will, underpin effective implementation in country, and to improve sharing and learning between countries and across sectors, building on work done by the Know Violence in Childhood global learning initiative. \\nThe Partnership will make the case to governments and other partners to invest in and strengthen data collection, including incidence and prevalence data, and evidence on costs and effectiveness.\\nMonitoring and Evaluation - In order to evaluate its work, the Partnership will develop a results framework and a monitoring and evaluation plan. The Partnership, as a learning organization, will also develop and disseminate models and best practice for evaluating the impact of violence prevention initiatives.\\n : Coordination mechanisms/governance structure\\nThe Partnership offers the opportunity for everyone who believes in ending violence against children to come together, combine their efforts and maximize their impact. Governments, international organizations, NGOs and civil society, academia, the private sector, and children themselves can all find a place in this collective endeavor. The Partnership will fully involve all partners in line with the principles of inclusiveness and transparency.\\nEach of these stakeholders can make a valuable contribution and this will be reflected in the Partnership\\x92s governance arrangements. Governance will be as lean as possible, especially at first. Structures will evolve as the Partnership grows and changes. The Partnership will also take time to get structures right at national level.\\nThe Partnership will have the following governance bodies:\\n\\x95\\tA Board which will set overall direction and mission, and approve the Partnership strategy, which will be updated after three years.\\n\\x95\\tAn Executive Committee which will develop the annual business plan and budget based on the strategy.\\nThese bodies will be supported by a Partnership Secretariat, which will:\\n\\x95\\tDevelop strategy and policy for Executive Committee approval.\\n\\x95\\tLead on programming, advocacy, communication and resource mobilization.\\n : Partner(s)\\n* UNICEF\\n* World Health Organization (WHO)\\n* UN Women\\n* United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)\\n* United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\\n* ChildFund Alliance\\n* Plan International\\n* Save the Children\\n* SOS Children's Villages\\n* World Vision\\n* Elevate Children Fund\\n* Various foundations, private sector, leaders of faith, children and young people\"\n",

HELCOM together with its partners will promote the green shipping technology and use of alternative fuels to further reduce harmful exhaust gas emissions and greenhouse gases from ships. \\n\\r\\nThe International Maritime Organization approved the Baltic Sea NOx Emission Control Area (NECA) proposal by the HELCOM countries in 2016 with an effective date of 1 January 2021. The North Sea NECA has been agreed in parallel. The final IMO agreement on the adoption of the two NECAs is expected in July 2017.\\n\\r\\nEutrophication, caused by excessive inputs of nutrients, is a serious environmental concern and a priority for action by the Baltic Sea countries working in HELCOM. The measure will result in reduction of 22,000 tons of annual total nitrogen deposition to the whole region, as a combined effect of the Baltic and North Seas NECAs. Out of this, 7,000 tons is estimated to be reduced directly to the sea surface. \\n\\r\\nThe NECA regulations target new ships built on or after 2021 and do not address existing ships. A two-decade long period of fleet renewal is needed before the regulation will show the full effect. Parallel work to promote the green shipping technology and use of alternative fuels, as means of compliance with NECA, will be undertaken by HELCOM and in the region to facilitate emission reductions ahead of the regulatory schedule. \\r\\nA regional public-private partnership on green technology and alternative fuels for shipping called HELCOM GREEN TEAM has been established for this purpose. The NECA regulation brings a new momentum and a demand to intensify the public-private partnership. The new work plan of the partnership, adopted in 2017, aims to promote public and private co-operation at national and Baltic Sea levels to enhance development and uptake of green technology and alternative fuels in shipping, including LNG. The work will be undertaken jointly by HELCOM countries in co-operation with other regional governmental and non-governmental organizations, the industry and research community.'\n",

Besides inventing new technologies, GreenTouch is committed to quantifying and validating the energy efficiency benefits and demonstrating the key enabling technologies.\\n : Implementation methodologies\\nGreenTouch considers as feasible the reduction by 2020 of the net energy consumption in communication networks by up to 90%. This would be possible thanks to a dramatic improvements in energy efficiency in key networks. This result demonstrates the capacity to support predicted traffic growth in future networks, whilst significantly reducing the total energy consumption of the networks . These results are even more important as they represent significant opportunities to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by up to 16% through their indirect enabling effect on other industrial sectors.\\n : Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer \\n : Coordination mechanisms/governance structure\\n : Partner(s)\\nGreentouch Consortium'\n",

The objective is that by 2020 100% of the threatened species are under protection by at least one conservation instrument. \\n\\r\\nConcerned with the need for a comprehensive approach for cetacean conservation in the South Atlantic Ocean, Brazil is proposing additional strategies that include the coordination of regional efforts to ensure the recovery of cetacean resources and their non-extractive and non-lethal use, including through a South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary under the International Whale Commission and actions in other related fora. The South Atlantic has 51 species of cetaceans - six of these (blue, fin, sei, Antarctic minke, humpback and southern right whales) are highly migratory baleen whales that feed in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic oceans during summer and breed in tropical, subtropical and temperate waters in winter and spring in the South Atlantic Ocean. In line with the expanding scope of whale conservation and management, issues beyond the decisions on lethal takes may include present and potential threats to whale stocks and their habitats within the region, such as interactions with fisheries, entanglement, collisions with ships, contaminants, ingestion of debris, acoustic and noise pollution, hydrocarbon exploration, climate change, die offs, and others.'\n",

      "'The Black Sea is one of the most isolated inland seas in the world. The Black Sea biodiversity is rather confined in comparison, for instance, with the Mediterranean Sea, owing to its geographical isolation, low water salinity and cooler environment, as well as because of a large amount of anoxic waters enriched with poisonous hydrogen sulphide. The Black Sea represents a specific bio-geographic region with its own characteristic blend of vegetation, climate and geology.\\n\\r\\nThe Black Sea plays enormous social and economic role for the surrounding countries  it provides important food (fish, molluscs), transport links to the other seas, recreational values. The marine ecosystem is highly fragile due to its isolation and many species are in bad conservation status. Different pressures and threats affect the Black Sea negatively: over fishing, pollution and introduction of invasive alien species, climate change, etc. \\n\\r\\nGeneral public is getting more and more sensitive to the environmental problems and is urging governments to act. In recent years at global scale new concept for development of different spheres of science is applied  citizen science or \"public participation in scientific research\". This approach is scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur or nonprofessional scientists mainly in collection of data on observations or regular monitoring of target species. Main stakeholder groups will be people living in the coastal areas as well as holiday-makers, students in natural sciences and groups that regularly sail the seas (yachtsmen, sailors, fishermen). \\n\\r\\nThe actions main goal is raising public awareness on the Black Sea biodiversity and the contribution each one can made for conservation of this fragile ecosystem. Using a contemporary tool like smart phone application and web-based data base will guarantee the interest of the young increasingly using these tools rather than older means of communication and data recording.   \\n\\r\\nSmart phone Apps and website should include information for identification of all marine species (mammals, birds, fish, invertebrates, macroalgae, etc.) in the Black Sea, especially species in the Red Data Book, invasive, harmful and key species. Users will be able to send photographs with location data (GPS) through this system. After the confirmation of the identification of the species by experts, the record will be added to the map on the project website. In this way everyone can see the distribution map of marine creatures in the Black Sea and become a part of a scientific project. The gathered information is aimed to be published in scientific journals with the cooperation of both amateur and professional scientists. The obtained data will be used with the permissions of data contributors. Essentially, this is a project adapted to our region (Black Sea), called \"Citizen Science\" in European countries, which aims to collect data for social benefits by an easy and inexpensive way and also increasing public awareness on marine biodiversity.'\n",

      "'Despite a number of legal acts that regulate emissions and occurrence of hazardous substances in water bodies, several groups of priority hazardous substances, can still be found in the environment and are still emitted. While industrial sources have a solid framework which regulates the emissions of hazardous substances, the majority of small scale emitters of wastewaters (households, enterprises and service providers and municipal entities) are so far weakly regulated and controlled. For several hazardous substances, these small scale emitters are responsible for the majority of the pollution load. Urban areas are in many cases emission hotspots.\\n\\r\\nPolluted wastewaters and storm water, coming from uses of products and materials containing hazardous substances, end up in municipal wastewater treatment facilities which in many cases are unable to effectively treat this type of pollution. This means that with traditional enforcement techniques (permitting, supervision, inspection) the set policy goals are impossible to reach, innovative measures are urgently needed.\\n\\r\\nThe project aims at identifying and addressing these small scale emitters by various means, adapted to each specific target group. Municipal entities themselves shall exercise own substance reduction measures at their premises. Private small scale businesses and households, will be motivated for voluntary commitments for less hazardous substances by the expert partners and by cooperation with municipal authorities. The actions will not only decrease emissions to protect the environment but also the health of humans in contact with these products and materials. The project will result in Chemicals Action Plans for partner municipalities that will guide their future work with reducing emissions of hazardous substances from enterprises, households and their own entities.\\n\\r\\nDue to the fact that hazardous substance management at urban areas is a new issue for most municipalities, the development of actions will benefit from a wider, transnational perspective. Municipalities can learn from each other and test out ideas developed in other municipalities. This will help to generate more effective solutions. The results will be communicated to inspire also other municipalities to work with these problems.\\n\\r\\nThe aim is to increase efficiency of water management for decreased discharges of hazardous substances to the Baltic Sea and the regional waters based on enhanced capacity of public and private actors. NonHazCity wants to demonstrate possibilities of municipalities and WWTPs to reduce emissions of priority hazardous substances. NonHazCity acts in 11 municipalities (Stockholm, Vsters, Turku, Prnu, Riga, Kaunas district, Silale, Klaipeda, Gdansk, Lbeck, Hamburg) in the Baltic Sea region. Each of them will be involved in the project  as partner or associate.'\n",

To carry this out, they have been experimenting with 35 different consortiums of agroforestry systems since 2000. The research station offers students of Bolivia and the world the possibility of learning by doing as well as to carry out scientific research.

Our growth strategy, which is inspired by our Purpose, is to touch and improve more consumers' lives, in more parts of the world, more completely.\\n One critical way we are executing this strategy is to reach and serve five billion people with our products and services by the midpoint of this decade, up from less than four billion just two years ago. We're confident we can improve these billions of lives if we can reach people where they shop with products and services they need and want. But we also know that we must achieve our growth sustainably and responsibly. To do otherwise would be inconsistent with our Purpose and what we stand for as a Company.\\n The whole company is involved in delivering these goals.\\n : Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer \\n : Coordination mechanisms/governance structure\\n : Partner(s)\\nOur key partners for the P&amp;G; Children's Safe Drinking Water Goals can be found here : http://www.csdw.org/csdw/global-partners.shtml\"\n",
