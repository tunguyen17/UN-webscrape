Singapore is a participating country to the Regional Plan of Action to Promote Responsible Fishing Practices including Combating IUU Fishing in the Region (RPOA-IUU). The RPOA-IUU is a voluntary instrument which seeks, among other things, to strengthen regional efforts to tackle IUU fishing in the South China Sea, Sulu-Sulawesi Seas (Celebes Sea) and the Arafura-Timor Seas. It also serves as a regional information sharing network on sustainable fisheries management. The members of RPOA-IUU are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Republic of Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, The Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor Leste and Viet Nam.Singapore also contributes to regional capability building efforts to combat IUU fishing in the region. Through the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Centre (SEAFDEC, an intergovernmental body established in 1967 to promote sustainable fisheries development in Southeast Asia), Singapore is the lead country for the development of (i) the ASEAN Guidelines for Preventing the Entry of Fish and Fish Products from IUU Fishing Activities into the Supply Chain that was adopted by AMAF in 2015, and (ii) the ASEAN Catch Documentation Scheme, which is currently a work in progress.'\n",

The EU's Circular Economy Strategy will reinforce the implementation of the 3 'R's (reduce, reuse, recycle). The EU is addressing the issue of sea-based sources of marine litter through the implementation of the Port Reception Facilities Directive which aims to reduce the discharges of ship generated waste and cargo residues into the sea and which is currently being reviewed. The EU will provide financial support, notably under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, to promote marine litter clean-up as a complement to prevention measures, in particular through providing support for increasing capacity to collect marine litter and to increase the availability of data on litter concentrations in seas around the EU.\"\n",

Reduced levels and impacts of (accumulated) marine debris on shorelines, aquatic habitats, and biodiversity.It is anticipated that different stakeholders will form sub-groups to focus on specific issues, e.g. cross-cutting issues. Establishment of additional Partnership Areas would be based on the willingness and availability of lead members for these Areas.   Implementation methodologiesThe Global Partnership on Marine Litter (GPML), besides being supportive of the Global Partnership on Waste Management, seeks to protect human health and the global environment by the reduction and management of marine litter as its main goal, through several specific objectives: To reduce the impacts of marine litter worldwide on economies, ecosystem, animal welfare and human health; To enhance international cooperation and coordination through the promotion and implementation of the Honolulu Strategy - a global framework for the prevention and management of marine debris, as well as the Honolulu Commitment \\x96 a multi-stakeholder pledge; To promote knowledge management, information sharing and monitoring of progress on the implementation of the Honolulu Strategy; To promote resource efficiency and economic development through waste prevention (e.g. 4Rs (reduce, re-use, recycle and re-design) and by recovering valuable material and/or energy from waste; To increase awareness on sources of marine litter, their fate and impacts; and to assess emerging issues related to the fate and potential influence of marine litter, including (micro) plastics uptake in the food web and associated transfer of pollutants and impacts on the conservation and welfare of marine fauna.Expected outcomes of the GPML include: Increased awareness of the impacts of marine litter at various levels \\x96 e.g. policy-makers, industry, and the general public.Increased body of knowledge on communities of best practices to address marine litter by various stakeholders around the world at various levels, and how their activities contribute to the implementation of the Honolulu Strategy; Identification and filling of knowledge gaps and establishing organizational knowledge processes; Strengthened and coordinated global and regional networks/nodes on /for marine litter; Enhanced resource efficiency by avoiding duplication of efforts, streamlining of resource utilization and information sharing across multiple activities.Increased economic development and job creation opportunities in marine litter prevention and management.Improved synergy among stakeholders including academia, NGOs, the private sector, governments and international organizations; Enabled complementarities between the partnership and relevant Conventions and other international instruments, action plans, initiatives, and activities.Systematic publication of scoping papers and global assessments on emerging issues associated with marine litter.Increased mobilization of resources to address marine litter mitigation.Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer The first Massive Open Online Course on Marine Litter was launched in 2015 and ended in January 2016. UNEP is now planning for the Second MOOC to be available in 2017. Coordination mechanisms/governance structureUNEP through the GPA provides the Secretariat for the GPML. An international Steering Committee provides guidance. Members webinars have also been initiated to better provide updates and announce opportunities for engagement of partners.

The club targets youths from the age range of 11-17 in public and private Secondary schools in Nigeria for overall National Development. The need to establish a social club or a forum where youths would be engaged on the importance of the SDG\\'s or to have a first hand knowledge of all the 17 Goals is imperative. This club seek ways in which these youths can play active roles in the implementation of the UN Agenda.  Implementation methodologiesThis Initiative will be carried out in primarily all public schools with assenting private schools in Nigeria, the need to allow these youths run and play active role in the set up of this initiative will be highly encouraged. since, the initiative is already in its take off stage, the response we got from the pioneer session has encouraged us to know that Youths of this age are well aware of the problems around them and feel then need to contribute in any way to the implementation of this agenda. Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer We seek to establish a library in each school where documents, books, Products on the SDG\\'s would be readily available for this students, we also seek to create a forum for advocacy and awareness creation. we seek to distribute brochures, palmtops, laptops and pamphlets with unique signs, pictures, videos and print out on how best to implement the 2030 agenda. A public speaking session would be created every month where these students would meet resource persons, scholars, stake holders in sectors relating to SDG\\'s and its implementation. Coordination mechanisms/governance structureThe project will be structured in a very practical way, where the students will be divided into groups in each of the schools, from each group one person will be selected top serve on the executive council in that particular school. This very bright student from the group will speak about the indicators and targets of his/her particular group.This 17 Excos in each school will see to the monthly running of this club in their respective school, they will in collaboration with a project officer from our organization plan out Activities, Reach out sessions, Awareness and Advocacy sessions.

Source: UNCSD Secretariat (2010) Questionnaire for the Member States on Experiences, Success Factors, Risks and Challenges with Regard to Objective and Themes of UN Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD)Desktops, laptops and monitors that meet 23 required environmental performance criteria may be registered in EPEAT by their manufacturers in 40 countries worldwide. Registered products are rated Gold, Silver or Bronze depending on the percentage of 28 optional criteria they meet above the baseline criteria. EPEAT ratings are product assessments against lifecycle environmental performance criteria. These criteria are developed through stakeholder consensus and are contained in the IEEE 1680 Family of Standards for Environmental Assessment of Electronic Products. EPEAT operates an ongoing verification program to assure the credibility of the registry. In 2008, U.S. purchases of EPEAT registered laptops, desktops, and monitors over conventional products resulted in reductions in the use of toxic materials, including mercury, by 1,021 metric tons and reduction of over 1.57 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions over the useful life of the products.

      "'Description/achievement of initiativeIn Bangladesh, women are often employed at the lower end of the productivity scale. Labor force participation of rural women in Bangladesh is only 36.4% against 83.3% of men. Creating employment and income generating opportunities for women and enhancing women\\x92s access to social protection will help to reduce gender inequality and women\\x92s poverty and vulnerability.  The SDG Fund JP is being implemented in the regions of focus in the Kurigram district in the Northwest and Satkhira district in the coastal belt, regions strongly affected by seasonal hunger and high incidences of extreme poverty due to natural disasters and climate change.    Implementation methodologiesThe SWAPNO JP offers a scalable, government-owned model aimed at participants\\x92 lasting exit from poverty. The women will be employed for 18 months in maintaining or rehabilitating important community assets, public works, and community service.The programme is being implemented through the Community Based Training for Rural Economic Empowerment (CB-TREE) approach which has been piloted by ILO in Bangladesh. The model combines a community based survey of skills demand and development of training to fill the identified skills gaps. Individuals are trained with the in-demand skills for subsequent work in either established SMEs or in their own micro-enterprises.Field application of the CB-TREE model includes the following steps:1. Select a village, mobilize target group2. Apply TREE planning tools and process3. Implement approved training proposals (3 types: i. skills training alone, ii. skills with enterprise training, and iii. enterprise training alone)4. Beneficiaries access finance, establish common facilities, organize enterprise (value) chains5. Beneficiaries trade with other communities or adjacent urban centres6. When ready and willing-the individual, group or community enterprises can be linked with the formal financial and market systemsFurther, in accordance with the code of practice, an employer or instructor must:- train the apprentice or nominate a skilled tradesperson to train the apprentice to the best of their ability;- provide apprentices with the opportunity to learn all the skills of the trade as listed in the CSLB;- provide the apprentices with the opportunity &amp; sufficient time to practice the skills listed in the CSLB in order to become skilled workers;- complete the employer/instructor section of the CSLB as required in an honest &amp; accurate manner;- provide ongoing feedback and encouragement to the apprentice;-  treat the apprentice fairly and as an important member of the workplace;- provide a safe work/learning environment.In addition to some 10,000 members of direct beneficiary households, local communities with a population of around 1.1 million living below the poverty line will be indirect beneficiaries of public works undertaken in the SWAPNO programme. Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer Local government has the capacity to implement social transfer programmes in an accountable and transparent manner, following a gender sensitive and pro-poor approach.Activities include:\\x95 Development of an Operational Manual\\x95 Development of Internal Control Framework\\x95 Training needs assessment\\x95 In-country and cross-country training for 72 Union Councils and 9 Sub-district councils, engaging National Institute of Local Government\\x95 On-the-job coaching\\x95 Peer training by best practitioners / horizontal learning\\x95 Financial monitoring with parallel knowledge transfer of good practices\\x95 District workshops\\x95 Advocacy, knowledge management and visibility activities\\x95 Baseline and endline surveys\\x95 Monitoring of the development of Union Council capacitiesThe capacity of Union Councils will be developed so that they can perform the following key tasks:(a) Arrange for selection of primary beneficiary women and guide formation of crew groups;(b) Assist in selection of roads and other public works;(c) Monitor task assignment and performance of crews through a Standing Committee; solve criticalproblems; prepare reports; ensure management, supervision and payment;(d) Facilitate cooperation between the Union Council and service delivery departments for effective servicedelivery to programme beneficiaries; establish contact between women and service providers;(e) Identify priority service needs and manage service delivery block grants for essential needs;(f) Facilitate cooperation from participating banks and other payment agents and assist in account opening for primary beneficiary women;(g) Provide graduated women with follow-up and counselling for sustainable livelihoods;(h) Maintain all records, registers, accounts, etc. prescribed.Capabilities of local government institutions will be developed in terms of accountability, transparency, pro-poor planning, gender sensitiveness and participatory M&amp;E.; To enhance sustainability prospects, capacity development training will be imparted through National Institute of Local Government (NILG), with technical assistance from the programme in the development of training modules, training of trainers and so forth. This will at the same time develop NILG capacity to impart similar capacity development training in other Unions of the country. Strengthening local government capacity not only supports effective programme implementation but also strengthens a range of service delivery mechanisms. Effective capacity for pro-poor and gender sensitive service delivery requires both capability and commitment, and the programme will work on both.Coordination mechanisms/governance structureThe SDG Fund relies on the UN Resident Coordinator (RC) to facilitate collaboration between Participating UN Organizations to ensure that the programme is on track and that promised results are being delivered. The Resident Coordinator exercises his authority over the programme by being entrusted with leadership of the overall programme design, ongoing programmatic oversight of the Fund\\x92s activities by co-chairing the National Steering Committee meetings. To ensure proper checks and balances of programme activities the RC is called upon to establish committees at two levels:A National Steering Committee (NSC), and Programme Management Committee(s) (PMC).The NSC consists of the Resident Coordinator, a representative of the national government in the role of Co-Chair and a representative of the AECID or in its absence from another sponsoring partner entity, according to the SDGF ToR.The responsibilities of the PMC will include:1.\\tEnsuring operational coordination2.\\tAppointing a Programme Manager or equivalent thereof;3.\\tManaging programme resources to achieve the outcomes and output defined in the programme;4.\\tEstablishing adequate reporting mechanisms in the programme;5.\\tIntegrating work plans, budgets, reports and other programme related documents; and ensuring that budget overlaps or gaps are addressed;6.\\tProviding technical and substantive leadership regarding the activities envisaged in the Annual Work Plan;7.\\tAgreeing on re-allocations and budget revisions and making recommendations to the NSC as appropriate;8.\\tAddressing management and implementation problems;9.\\tIdentifying emerging lessons learned; and10.\\tEstablishing communication and public information plans.Partner(s)UN Lead Agency: United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)UN Participating Organizations: International Labour Organization (ILO)Local Partners: Local Government Division, Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperative, Government of Bangladesh; District Administration, Sub-District Councils, Union Parishads (lowest administrative tier of local government), Partner NGO-Eco-Social Development Organization and Local Small and Medium Enterprises'\n",

Coastal erosion, sedimentation, land-based pollution, red tide, the loss and deterioration of mangrove, seagrass bed, coral reef and coastal wetland and decline of biodiversity are the main challenges this area is facing. To address the above threats, the GEF SGP China will support at least 10 local NGOs\\' activities in this area by using community seascape conservation approach through promotion of sustainable fishing, development of mangrove integrated ecological aquaculture and other alternative livelihood, restoration and conservation of mangroves, seagrass bed, coral reefs and coastal wetland, strengthening of monitoring and evaluation on sewage draining sources and control of land-based pollution. This initiative will contribute to the implementation of the Strategic Action Programme for the South China Sea.The landscape approaches that will be tested in this areas aims to balance the economic development and ecological conservation by ptomoting community traditional knowledge, community conservation by custom laws and sustainable use of marine resources to ensure the continued protection or ecological restoration of this area. The network of NGOs/CBOs and the multi-stakeholders decision-making mechanism will be established at this area to guarantee the integrated seascape approaches to be tested.'\n",

Source: UNCSD Secretariat (2010) Questionnaire for the Member States on Experiences, Success Factors, Risks and Challenges with Regard to Objective and Themes of UN Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) \"The European Reference Framework for Sustainable Cities\" offers a multi-purpose decision-making and communication tool for promoting sustainable urban development. It is not place-specific and can be adapted to suit local priorities and different circumstances. The tool shows and explains step-by-step what actions are possible or necessary to organise the process in a city or municipality, that is to say to help the city develop in an integrated manner. The users are guided through a series of questions to explore their city\\'s approach to sustainability and provide them with tools for improving this. Tools and supporting guidance are also given to monitor implementation and to evaluate the results. The tool is designed in a flexible way, in order to be adapted and enriched according to the particular situation of the city or municipality, and also in each national context (translation, specific documentation or indicators, etc.).Implementation methodologiesArrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer Coordination mechanisms/governance structurePartner(s)'\n",

It lowers its Barge Tray fully below water level causing all the Plastic Trash to float out of the Tray, unloading the SRB.Pumps cycle the water inside the sleuth gates to shift Plastic Garbage to the collection point, and the SRB leaves the port for its next journey to the Trash Gyre.'\n",

      "'Rationale:The publics awareness and engagement is a prerequisite for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. While addressing the Agenda, conflicts of interest may arise between goals and targets. UNESCO Biosphere Reserves are places where these conflicts are addressed, where needs are identified and analysed, where synergies are explored and where communities are included in finding solutions to sustainability challenges. With small means and little formal power have biosphere reserves achieved a range of results by connecting local initiatives to national and international strategies, by connecting people and nature, and by stimulating new knowledge development as well as education for sustainable development. The success of the biosphere reserves is based on collaboration, learning and a holistic view on people and nature  connecting local and global perspectives. Their thorough experience of integrated work with sustainable development in practice make them interesting as strategic areas to learn from, invest in, and support the implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.There are seven countries involved in the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) around the Baltic Sea and at least nine biosphere reserves that are in direct context of the Baltic Sea. This means that there is a potential good source of interdisciplinary approaches that has generated experiences connected to for example water quality management, sustainable fisheries, processes for community engagement, ecosystem based management, sustainable certification schemes and much more. Aim:The aim of the project is to facilitate learning from biosphere reserves (BRs), both within the UNESCO MAB Programme and with other networks, organizations and stakeholders. In order to better share good practices and inspiring activities with regards to implementing the SDGs, the project also aims to extract stories and communicate these to different target audiences.

Créé par les Etats-Unis dans les années 60, il a évolué ces dernières années vers un nouveau concept, le Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) qui a été développé par le CNRS.Ce reacteur  présente la particularité d\\x92utiliser un combustible liquide constitué du mélange de sels fondus LiF-ThF4-UF4 (77-19-4 mol%) et peut fonctionner en spectre rapide.   Implementation methodologiesDans ces conditions, le réacteur est à la fois « brûleur » d\\x92actinides mineurs mais aussi surgénérateur (production de matière fissile).  Le concept MSFR répond ainsi aux critères essentiels des réacteurs de Génération IV, en particulier la sûreté intrinsèque du réacteur (coefficients de réaction négatifs), le développement durable et la gestion des actinides mineurs. Le traitement du sel est intégré au procédé et étudié en parallèle des études neutroniques. Le projet présenté ici a pour objet l'étude de la chimie du sel fondu, sa stabilité thermique dans le temps ainsi que les différentes étapes de traitement du sel combustible. Ces étapes (fluoration, extraction réductrice) sont basées sur les propriétés redox et acido-basiques du sel fondu et des produits de fission qui y sont formés.

The natural and economic assets of the NMC will emerge as drivers of national and regional development on a scale not previously realised in East Africa, from living assets, hydrocarbons and human resources, and place unprecedented strain on ecosystems and natural resources. The Northern Mozambique Channel partnership is emerging, and will involve countries, civil society and the private sector with the goal to deliver a sustainable blue economy that preserves and builds the wealth of the region across the natural, social, and economic capitals.  Its long term vision, that \\x93the people, countries and economies of the Northern Mozambique Channel prosper in a sustainable future founded on the natural and cultural assets and diversity of the region\\x94 is concordant with Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals. National consultations in the Western Indian Ocean from February to May 2017 culminated in a regional workshop involving 7 countries of the region, that identified 4 themes and 3 cross-cutting themes modelled on the priorities and commitments being submitted for the Oceans Conference:\\x95\\tRegional collaboration on combating pollution and contingency planning\\x95\\tSustainable management of shared fish resources\\x95\\tOceans and climate change: transition to a low carbon pathway \\x95\\tIntegrated ocean governance\\x95\\tCross-cutting: harmonization of policy, sharing research and knowledge, and developing innovative financing mechanismsThese relate to the voluntary commitment \"Regional Partnership for Implementing SDG14 in the Western Indian Ocean\" led by the Nairobi Convention (#15788), adding technical detail under the themes identified in that commitment. This voluntary commitment elaborates deliverable 3 of #15788, and is submitted by NGO partners to support the countries in the implementation of their priorities within the Northern Mozambique Channel, through our upcoming projects and resource mobilisation efforts. The SDG 14 Oceans Conference will serve as a key milestone from which the national commitments made by the countries of the region, as well as joint commitments at a regional level, will form the foundation for the implementation of partnership activities in the Northern Mozambique Channel.'\n",

This is a program targeting children aged between 6 years and 15 years who are in primary schools. The ILead Program supplements academic learning by refocusing skills education for self-reliance and offers mentorship on life skills, education, talent &amp; leadership.  Implementation methodologiesPROBLEM DEFINITIONPrimary schools in urban slums of Kenya face socio-economic challenges which negatively impacts on education outcome. Some of the challenges faced by children and youths living in these areas include:1.\\tEnvironmental hazards e.g. poor sanitation2.\\tUnemployment3.\\tInsecure neighborhoods4.\\tIlliteracy5.\\tPoor reading culture6.\\tLack of self-awareness exhibited by low self esteemThe ILead Program seeks to address:1.\\tPoor reading culture2.\\tIlliteracy3.\\tSelf-awareness4.\\tUnemploymentThe ILead Program is basically ment to supplement academic learning with training on how to read, write, spell and help children to learn how to express themselves with confidence. We want to raise a generation of young people who can articulate their views on matters both at community and national level. Our implementation methodology is that Literature Africa Foundation has trained volunteers who act as after school tutors for children in the Damascus and Makao schools in Korogocho slums. Each tutor is assigned to a class of students from Primary 1 to Primary 7 where they train and mentor the students on education, life skills, social skills, technical skills, art and leadership. The tutors also teach the children how to read, write and spell. We are working on having the teachers trained and equipped with modern day teaching methods in order to improve on the quality of how they deliver education.Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer Coordination mechanisms/governance structureLiterature Africa Foundation (LAF) is currently running the ILead Program in Damascus School and Makao school in Korogocho Slums Nairobi in partnership with Hope For Future organization. In future, we intend to partner with the Government, Academia, the local communities and other civil societies so as to extend our scope and ensure successful implementation of the ILead Program. Hope For Future organization runs the 2 schools while Literature Africa Foundation runs the program and does all the reporting, monitoring and evaluation and general administration of the program. LAF has designed a curriculum which our volunteer educators, mentors and trainers use to educate the children especially on life skills and social skills.Partner(s)Literature Africa Foundation, KenyaHope for Future, Kenya'\n",

Implementation methodologiesThe following programmatic strategies will be adopted to carry out this initiative:\\x95 VAAGDHARA will spread its work in more locations, it will form and nurture vibrant community institutions such as self-help groups of women (SHGs), federations of SHGs, school management committees, etc. It will help poor and tribal access government programs and projects which are meant for their development, and explore their ultimate potential to develop their own work on sustainability. \\x95 VAAGDHARA will continue piloting innovative livelihoods initiatives to generate knowledge and develop appropriate technology for the local context. It will feed the knowledge and technologies to policy makers and strive for better interventions (programs) and enabling policies for integrated development of poor and tribal. \\x95 VAAGDHARA will also support other grass root organizations to implement integrated development programs in other tribal areas where VAAGDHARA may not implement directly- such as resource support organizations for sustainable integrated farming systems, and horticulture development programs.\\x95 VAAGDHARA will not be a hard core activist organization, rather it will organize people to leverage the government programs and also put pressure to get their rights. We will aim for constructive collaboration with government and other mainstream institutions without losing the focus and intensity of people\\x92s concerns.\\x95 VAAGDHARA will develop local development resource pool thus it will identify local people from the community it works with, build their capacities and involve them in development initiatives.\\x95 VAAGDHARA will promote the adoption of appropriate technology (simple yet scientific technology) which will be specific to the local context and which community can adopt easily. Adequate care will be taken while selecting the technology that there is no adverse impact on the local climate and people are able to manage the adverse impact of climate change. For example, preference will be on use of compost manure and Integrated pest management &amp; integrated nutrition management in agriculture over chemicals. Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer VAAGDHARA has learnt that strong community institutions are indispensable for sustaining any development intervention. Different institutions will be formed and nurtured, including various stakeholders at different levels. Community resource persons and community leaders will be developed at local level to manage the interventions/initiatives, and they will be trained on managing community-based organizations. These institutions and individuals will pass on the message to their respective communities and will involve maximum number of people in this initiative to achieve the goals and targets. VAAGDHARA has also decided to develop a local resource pool, thus it will identify local people from the community it works with, build their capacities as per the decided goals and involve them in development initiatives to reach the maximum number of people. All the above mentioned institutions/ initiatives will be governed by our organization\\x92s team members and volunteers.  Coordination mechanisms/governance structureIn order to achieve the sustainable development goals by 2030, VAAGDHARA has a strategy to promote and nurture vibrant institutions working on behalf of the poor such as self-help groups (SHG), SHG federations, farmer producer organizations, etc.,  who will be sensitive towards child development and can also work on livelihood, education, health, and nutrition. These institutions will be the key for the sustainability of interventions. VAAGDHARA will play the role of a catalyst and facilitator for institutions and networks of communities in remote and resource fragile regions so they start their journey towards sustainable development.VAAGDHARA has experienced team members and subject experts who are skilled in providing trainings on various subjects. Those team members and the subject experts will impart training to the above-mentioned stakeholders, including volunteers. Training of trainers will also be done, considering the reach of the initiative. Apart from this, piloting of innovative livelihoods initiatives will be carried out to generate knowledge and develop appropriate technology for local contexts. The organization will also support other grassroots organizations willing to implement integrated development programs in other tribal areas where VAAGDHARA may not implement directly, and will act as a resource organization to them.Partner(s)VAAGDHARA, community-based organizations, federations'\n",

Source: World Resources Institute (2011) A Compilation of Green Economy Policies, Programs, and Initiatives from Around the World. The Green Economy in Practice: Interactive Workshop 1, February 11th, 2011 South Africa instituted an ad valorem CO2 emissions tax on new passenger vehicles in 2010. The emissions tax applies initially to passenger cars but will be extended to commercial vehicles once agreed CO2 standards for these vehicles have been set. The main objective of this emissions tax is to influence the composition of South Africa?s vehicle fleet to become more energy efficient and environmentally friendly, while generating an estimated R1 billion in revenue. Improvements in outdoor air quality associated with reduced pollution, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from new passenger vehicles, as well as increased incentives for purchasing fuel-efficient passenger and commercial vehicles are expected.

Several of our organizational goals and operating philosophies are closely aligned with the UN Sustainable Development goals. We are a Profit with Purpose organization. Our purpose includes economic development in developing countries, gender equality, access to education and availability of capital to small entrepreneurs and gender equality.   Implementation methodologiesOur executives and team members visit developing countries and sit down with the community leaders, small business owners and budding entrepreneurs to understand their challenges and goals. We also host educational and training seminars to help small and medium size businesses set the right foundation for growth. In the absence of local financial support systems, we provide foreign investments and growth capital, along with ongoing coaching to make sure that these small businesses are successful and they add economic value to their communities and countries. Due to the wide variety of industries we are involved in, our work impacts agriculture, climate change, job creation, financial systems, education and technology. We actively seek to support gender equality and female entrepreneurship by giving women and girls the opportunities they currently do not have in the developing countries. Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer Providing coaching and consulting services for capacity building, giving access to computers and software programs to small business owners, providing training on the use of technology and creating shared resources model between several businesses to lower the cost of capacity building, especially in the area of transportation and logistics. Coordination mechanisms/governance structureMembers of our team regularly visit developing countries and look for the areas where Global Development Partners, Inc. can play a role in making a difference. We primarily focus on entrepreneurship but the impact of our work expands into industrial development, agriculture growth, sustainability, climate change and gender equality as well as leveling the playing field for small business owners in developing countries who are at a clear disadvantage, due to the lack of education, business knowledge, access to growth capital and other support systems necessary for them to be successful and add value to their communities and countries by creating new jobs and shifting the import/export balance. We have funded and supported small businesses ranging from female owned chemical manufacturing businesses to small farmers focusing on organic produce and livestock in the Caribbean region.

      "\"Description/achievement of initiativeThe Bridge Initiative envisions a world where all youth are active participants of the social and economic development through relevant education and decent work. To achieve this, we will focus on Sub-Saharan African countries, starting with the Democratic Republic of Congo, by conducting research projects on the skills, education and opportunity gaps dividing youth from the job market. Evidence-based interventions will then be implemented in the form of training and education opportunities, skills development on workplace behaviors and entrepreneurship, and volunteer and internships placements with partner organizations in order to increase youth employability.  Implementation methodologiesRecruitment of Young Talent:The Bridge Initiative empowers youth with the information and resources they need to pursue careers with purpose through volunteerism and social entrepreneurship:* We identify talented youth in rural and urban areas through recruitment and selection processes in universities, churches and schools. * We also use social media to attract talent, then we build capacity of young people on soft, technical, and vocational skills that will better equip them for decent work. * We build capacity of young people and invest in their future, tapping into their potential to invest in a generation of young ethical leaders.Networking - Advocacy - Partnerships:Partnerships are essential to our success, that's why networking is key to our strategy. In partnership with the private sector, academic institutions, schools, government agencies, Ministries, Embassies, UN agencies, and civil society organizations, the Bridge Initiative is building a wide spectrum of high-quality opportunities for its volunteers to put their skills to use in order to gain experience, increase their employability, and make an impact to your organization and to society at large.Arrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer Capacity and technology transfer will be implemented through online platforms.Coordination mechanisms/governance structureThe Bridge Initiative will be implemented through partnerships with key stakeholders based in DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania, with a collaborative approach to make education more relevant to the needs of the 21st century workplace. This initiative will be governed by the Board of Directors of the Bridge Initiative, coordinated by an Executive Director and partner organizations based in 4 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania.

The initiative is also designed to work closely with other Level 2 partners' commitments for WSSD in, inter alia, Water for African and Asian cities, City-to-City Cooperation, and Training local authorities for sustainable urban development. The initiative aims to mainstream lessons learned from successful practices, policies and legislation in pro-poor, gender-sensitive urban development and in decentralisation and the empowerment of local authorities.  The initiative aims to learn from Best Practices, good policies and enabling legislation: aimed at feeding the lessons from best practices into the capacity development of local authorities, supported by UN-HABITAT, research &amp; training institutions and individual cities.  Expected results include - (a) More socially-inclusive and environmentally-sound urban development, particularly in developing countries, through the adoption of pro-poor, gender-sensitive urban policies; (b) More sustainable urbanisation processes and urban governance frameworks through decentralisation and the empowerment of local authorities.Implementation methodologiesArrangements for Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer Coordination mechanisms/governance structurePartner(s)Governments: Government of Brazil - Brazilian Inst. of Municipal Administration (IBAM) Government of Brazil - Caixa Economica Federal Government of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland - Development Planning Unit  Major Groups: Prague Institute (Czech Republic) World Assoc. of Cities &amp; Lcl Auth.

Its objective is the regulation and promotion of uses and activities according to the protection and sustainable use of marine resources taking in account the degradation tendencies and the suitability or capabilities of the ecosystems to support uses or activities. Mexican Territory is composed of a continental and insular area of 1,964,375 km2; a Territorial Sea and Economic Exclusive Zone of 3,149,920 km2; and a coastal line of 11,122 km. Mexican Marine Territory is divided in four regions: 1) Gulf of California, 2) Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea; 3) North Pacific; and 4) South Central Pacific. MSP is part of the agenda of the Mexican National Development Plan and the Mexican National Environmental Program for 2013-2018 and also of the National Policy for Oceans and Coast of the Inter Ministerial Commission for the Sustainable Development of Coast and Seas of Mexico (CIMARES, in Spanish).Implement the Strategic Action Program of the Gulf of Mexico Large Marine Ecosystem (GoMLME).GoMLME is an international project supported with 12.9 million dollars by the Global Environmental Facility to be implemented from 2017 to 2021. It is instrumented by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, executed by more than ten Mexican and international institutions with the participation of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of Mexico and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration of United States, as focal points. This project will contribute to:1.- Water quality improved using pollution reduction measures through ecosystem based management approach (EBM). In particular, for 50 industries with the highest pollution emissions:\\tBOD5, N and P emissions to water bodies reduced by 15%\\tIndustrial water consumption reduced by at least 10%2.- Rebuilding of targeted fish stocks is achieved through implementation of measures, such as update of regulatory framework and enforcement, capacity development, and monitoring including, for example withdrawal of 200 artisanal and 100 semi-industrial fisher boats (reducing respectively by 4.5% and 19% the nominal fishing effort). 2.03 Percent of fisheries moved to more sustainable levels.3.- Improve coastal and marine ecosystem health through the use of the ecosystem- based management approach (3,000 hectares of restored mangroves).https://www.thegef.org/project/implementation-strategic-action-program-gulf-mexico-large-marine-ecosystemDevelop the Ocean Health Index (OHI) of Mexico.OHI is supported by Conservation International and is a tailorable marine assessment framework to comprehensively and quantitatively evaluate ocean health. The OHI framework assesses a suite of key social, economic, and ecological benefits a healthy ocean provides, called goals. By analyzing these goals together and scoring them from 0-100, OHI assessments result in a comprehensive picture of the state of the ecosystem and can be communicated to a wide range of audiences. In the OHI framework a healthy ocean is one that sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future. The Ocean Health Index is not an index of ecosystem services. In creating an inventory of all elements that are considered part of a healthy ocean under a wider definition, various categories began to evolve.'\n",

      "\"A large percentage of Israel's population as well as major industrial infrastructure sites are situated along the Mediterranean coast. As a result, substantial emissions found their way directly or indirectly to the Sea. Domestic legislation allows the issuance of permits for the marine disposal of wastewater containing pollutants, providing a strict set of measures to reduce pollution as much as possible and whereas no suitable land based alternative exists.. Permits are issued by an interministerial committee comprising 8 representatives, including a representative of non-governmental organisations.In accordance with the Israeli National Action Plan to reduce Pollution from Land Based Activities we intend to further reduce permitted disposal of pollution loads from all wastewater from industrial and municipal installations which are sources of BOD, nutrients, heavy metals, oils and suspended solids, which are discharging directly into the marine environment.  Thus by the end of 2017, we intend to further reduce disposal of pollution loads by 80% from our 2012 baseline budget of pollutants.In addition, by 2022, relative to our 2012 baseline, Israel will be reducing indirect atmospheric emissions to the marine environment of NOx and SOx by 90% due to the planned installation of scrubbers in 6 coal powered units of the main coastal power stations as well as the closure of  4 coal power units.The reduction from direct effluents to the sea will be effected by limiting permits granted for the discharge of wastewater to the marine environment, by introducing best technological treatment facilities  and by providing land based alternatives which are preferable on environmental, economic and feasibility grounds  The reduction expected from non-direct atmospheric emissions is forecasted mainly due to the planned closure of 4 of the coal powered units; the installation of emission reduction technologies (SCR and FGD  technologies for the reduction of Sulphor and Nitrogen oxides) in the 6 remaining coal powered units and the environmentally sound use of mix of fuels (coal and gas) in the operation of power stations. The success of this reduction program will require measurement and verification carried out through an annual analysis of the data received by the industry and municipalities and also by examining data available from Israel's Pollutant Release and Transfer Registry (PRTR) and other available sources of data for cross referencing\"\n",
